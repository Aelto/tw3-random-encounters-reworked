    <h2>Encounters</h2>

    <p>
      Encounters in RER are random groups of creatures that you will come across in your
      world. These groups are spawned by RER around the player at random intervals.
      Each of these encounters have different behaviours and do completely different
      things, you can learn more by looking at their respective pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      As said earlier, encounters are spawned at random intervals. You can control
      this interval with the delay sliders in the <span>Encounters System / General</span>
      menu.
      <img src="delays.png" alt="image showing the two delay sliders">
      You can set different delays for the night and the day, particularely useful
      if you want encounters only during the night for example. In such case you'd
      set the day delays to a really high value like 600 seconds (10 minutes).
      <br>
      <img src="delays-per-level.png" alt="image showing the two delay sliders">
      There are two sliders for each, the minimum and maximum delay because RER
      picks a random value between the two intervals. So with the settings shown in
      the image RER will pick create an encounter at an interval between 60 and 130 seconds
      <br>
      Then on top of the default delay sliders, there is a unique slider to add a
      custom delay based on your current level: <span>Additional delay (in seconds) per player level</span>.
      At a first glance this slider may not seem very useful, but it allows you
      to create dynamic delays that progressively get shorter as you progress in the game.
      <br>
      For example, let's say you want a chill start but a rough ending at around level 50.
      You'd set the default sliders to around 300 seconds each and then you would set this slider
      to <span>-5</span>. Every time you level up the delays will be shorter by 5 seconds,
      that means you will get the following delays in your game:
      <ul>
        <li>300 seconds at level 0</li>
        <li>250 seconds at level 10</li>
        <li>200 seconds at level 20</li>
        <li>150 seconds at level 30</li>
        <li>100 seconds at level 40</li>
        <li>50 seconds at level 50</li>
      </ul>
      Of course you can adjust the values to get different results. But as you can see
      this sliders allows you to get different experiences based on your progress in
      the playthrough.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/Aelto/tw3-random-encounters-reworked/releases">RER v2.6</a> also
      introduces a new slider to control even more the delays and how often
      creatures are spawned.
      <img src="ecosystem-delay-multiplier.png" alt="image showing the two delay sliders">
      This slider controls how much repeatedly killing monsters in an area will
      affect the delays. RER will then adjust the pace at which it creates new creatures,
      the default value of <span>100</span> means that this feature works at 100%
      of its intended efficacy. This slider can also go below zero, into negative values to
      completely invert its effect on the delays.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default a killed Ghoul will increase the speed of spawns by 1.5%, but if you
      set the slider to <span>-100</span> then it will <b>slow down</b> the spawn speed
      by 1.5%. This was done to allow for immersive playthroughs where killing monsters of
      an area slowly eradicates any form of life from the region. The default value
      doesn't go the immersion route but rather gameplay experience route, as killing
      creatures will ensures even more creatures come.
      <br>
      However there is an important detail to remember here, it works on monster kills
      but also on monster spawns. With the default values a monster spawn will slow down
      the spawn rate of the next creatures in the area, this will help balance the
      amount of creatures you see in the same regions. And of course if you go for the
      immersive solution with a negative value more monsters will mean a greater spawn rate.
      That's where you may understand why i picked these default values!
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are wondering the state of the surrounding ecosystem and what's the spawn rate
      in the region, you can use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2txXNrz_QLY">ecosystem analyse</a> (
        <a href="https://aelto.github.io/tw3-random-encounters-reworked/indepth-guide/#part-4-4">setup guide</a>
      ) which will now include a line with the spawn rate
      <img src="ecosystem-analyser-delay_multiplayer.png" alt="">
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also control how far encounters are created as encounters are spawned
      around you. The distance sliders help you control this
      <img src="distances.png" alt="image showing the three distance sliders">
      the first slider, the <span>minimum spawn distance</span> controls the distance
      at which encounters cannot be created. It is a safe radius around you.
      <br>
      The second slider <span>spawn diameter</span> is the danger zone after the safe zone
      where encounters are created. So with the settings shown in the image encounters
      will be created between 40 meters and 160 meters from you.
      <br>
      The last slider, the <span>automatic kill threshold</span> tells at which distance
      RER considers an encounter lost and kills it to save performances. Because it is
      not guaranteed creature from encounters will go towards Geralt, this slider is important.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from RER are always spawned at Geralt's level, it ensures a pleasant experience.
      But you can control their level with the levels sliders
      <img src="levels.png" alt="">
      It is pretty simple, with <span>lowest: -3</span> and <span>highest: 3</span> you will get creatures
      with a random level around yours but never higher than three levels and never lower than three.
      <br>
      You can set both sliders to <span>+10</span> and every creatures will be ten levels higher than you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Static encounters are so simple that they don't deserve they own menu, so their
      spawn chance were set in this menu.
      <img src="staticencounters.png" alt="image showing static encounters sliders">
      If you want to learn more about them, see the static encounters page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creatures from encounters may drop tracks on the ground, this slider controls
      how often they leave tracks and how dense the trails will be.
      <img src="trailratio.png" alt="">
      A value around
      30% will result in vanilla like trails where tracks are placed every few meters.
      While 100% will result in really dense trails that are easier to follow. But note
      that RER limits 200 tracks per entity and after the limit is reached it starts
      recycling old tracks to save performances. With really dense trails the entities
      will reach the limit really fast and you may see trails disappear in front of your
      eyes.
