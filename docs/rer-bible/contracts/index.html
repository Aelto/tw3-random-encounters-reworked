    <h3>Starting a contract</h3>

    <p>
      RER displays only one errand on the noticeboard. This errand, once picked,
      may display a difficulty selector if the options allow it, then a dialogue
      menu with different options.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It first displays the tokens you can hope to get from this noticeboard.</li>
      <li>It then shows your <a href="#reputation">reputation</a> for this specific noticeboard.</li>
      <li>Finally it lists the available contracts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At this moment you can only accept one of the given contracts, to start a second
      one you will have to go back to the noticeboard and take the RER errand again.
      Doing so will cancel any currently unfinished RER contract you have in progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you picked the contract of your choice, RER will then pick among the list
      of known and discovered locations in the world. Reach the location and the
      contract will start.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Known locations and discovered locations</h3>

    <p>
      RER comes with a pre-defined list of known locations, these locations are
      hand-picked by the contributors and make for interesting places for contracts.
      It also uses the point of interests from the base game, bandit camps, caverns,
      places of powers, etc...
    </p>

    <p>
      However RER has the ability to learn about new locations as you explore the world.
      If the option is enabled, every time you will slay an enemy the mod will
      be notified and it will scan the surrounding for new potential locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a contract is picked, the mod will then have the ability to pick locations
      from the hand-placed locations but also the discovered locations for a greater
      variety.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The difficulty of the contracts</h3>

    <p>
      The difficulty of the contracts you play directly controls the strength of
      the creatures you will see during them. Creatures are given bonus armour as
      well as bonus damage to artificially increase the difficulty.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Completing contracts and rewards</h3>

    <p>
      Every time you will complete a contract, you will earn tokens of gratitude
      from the locals that you will be able to trade for valuables to the bounty master.
      For each token the trader will offer various types of rewards:
      <ul>
        <li>Consumables</li>
        <li>Crafting materials</li>
        <li>Gear</li>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Valuables</li>
        <li>Experience</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The rewards token you get from the completion of the contract however depends
      on the location where you started the contract. A poor Velen settlement does not
      have the same rewards as Novigrad for example.
    </p>

    <p>
      On top of getting tokens that you can later trade, you may also get jewels
      which you can sell for raw gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the difficulty of the contract you just completed, your reward may vary.
      Harder contracts result in more tokens. Your <a href="#reputation">reputation</a> also
      has an impact on how the locals will pay you. As your reputation grows your rewards will tend
      to increase.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- <section>
    <h3>Waiting for new contracts</h3>

    <p>
      Each noticeboard has a limit of contracts you can complete in a given lapse
      of time. The length depends on the value you set in the menu, and it is expressed
      in real life hours. That means meditating won't cause you to get new contracts and
      the only way to get new ones is to go for another noticeboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contracts that are generated each interval are seeded from the time spent
      in the playthrough and the location. This means that during the first hour of a
      playthrough the contract in White Orchard will be the same for all players
      across all computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If needed, the mod menu exposes a slider that can be changed to use another
      seed. However this will follow the same logic, any player with the same seed
      will get the same contracts or the same amount of time spent in the playthrough.
    </p>

  <section id="reputation">
    <h3><a class="paragraph-link" href="#reputation">§</a>Reputation and vanilla contracts</h3>

    <p>
      The mod introduces a simple reputation system to the game, as you complete
      contracts (from the mod) your reputation increases in the area. Each settlement
      and its noticeboard has its reputation metter, having a high reputation in Novigrad
      will not have an impact on other nearby settlements.
    </p>

    <p>
      People will not accept jobs from you until you have grown your reputation, you must
      first get known to be able to read the interesting offers. This accounts medium and hard
      contracts from the mod but vanilla contracts as well. If you wish to complete quests in
      the area you must first complete at least a few easy contracts from the noticeboard.
