    <h2>Contracts revamp</h2>

    <p>
      Complete revamp of the contracts system. The three types there are currently will
      be removed from the mod and will leave their place to 1 simpler and unified mechanism.
      <br>
      This system will offer a way to players to experience the life of a monster hunter
      without the need to leave themselves to the mercy of a randomly generated quest.
    </p>

    <p>
      I will start by showing what the mod menu will look like, this will demonstrate
      the whole setup and what to expect from it. Then i will go in details in how each step
      will work.
    </p>

    <h3>The contracts mod menu</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Real life hours before new contracts. Default: <span>1</span>.</li>
      <li>Number of nearby easy contract. Default: <span>1</span></li>
      <li>Number of nearby hard contract. Default: <span>1</span></li>
      <li>Number of far easy contract. Default: <span>1</span></li>
      <li>Number of far hard contract. Default: <span>1</span></li>
      <li>Allow RER to learn about new locations as you explore the world. Default: <span>true</span></li>
      <li>Contracts generation seed. Default: <span>0</span></li>
      <li>Chances for:
        <ul>
          <li> - Ogroid contracts. Default: <span>10</span></li>
          <li> - Draconid contracts. Default: <span>10</span></li>
          <li> - Specter contracts. Default: <span>10</span></li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h3>Starting a contract</h3>

    <p>
      RER now displays only one (1) errand on the noticeboard. This errand, once picked,
      will tell the mod to display a dialogue menu with different options. These options
      will depend on the values you set in the menu.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>First it will display the list of nearby easy contracts for a random monster species you can accept.</li>
      <li>In second, the list of nearby hard contracts</li>
      <li>In third, the list of far easy contracts</li>
      <li>In third, the list of far hard contracts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      At this moment you can only accept one of the given contracts, to start a second
      one you will have to go back to the noticeboard and take the RER errand again.
      Doing so will cancel any currently unfinished RER contract you have in progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you picked the contract of your choice, RER will then pick among the list
      of known and discovered locations in the world based on the distance of the contract.
      Reach the location and the contract will start.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Known locations and discovered locations</h3>

    <p>
      RER comes with a pre-defined list of known locations, these locations are
      hand-picked by the contributors and make for interesting places for contracts.
    </p>

    <p>
      However RER has the ability to learn about new locations as you explore the world.
      If the option is enabled, every time you will slay an enemy the mod will
      be notified and it will scan the surrounding for new potential locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a contract is picked, the mod will then have the ability to pick locations
      from the hand-made locations but also the discovered locations for a greater
      variety.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The hunting phase</h3>

    <p>
      Once the location reached and depending on the disance and the difficulty of the contract,
      you will face different kinds of situations:
      <ul>
        <li>Monsters nests</li>
        <li>Hordes of monsters</li>
        <li>A boss fight</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The objective is never really far away from the location of the contract, but will
      often require some searching to find it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The distance & difficulty of contracts</h3>

    <p>
      The distance of a contract decides if the picked location you have to reach
      will be around the noticeboard or if it will be around a neighbooring settlement or isle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The difficulty of the contract decides the risks to encounter a challenging creature
      during the completion of the encounter.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Completing contracts and rewards</h3>

    <p>
      Every time you will complete a contract, you will earn a token of gratitude
      from the locals that you will be able to trade for valuables to the bounty master.
      For each token the trader will offer various types of rewards:
      <ul>
        <li>Consumables</li>
        <li>Crafting materials</li>
        <li>Gear</li>
        <li>Golds</li>
        <li>Experience</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The rewards token you get from the completion of the contract however depends
      on the location where you started the contract. A poor Velen settlement does not
      have the same rewards as Novigrad for example.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Waiting for new contracts</h3>

    <p>
      Each noticeboard has a limit of contracts you can complete in a given lapse
      of time. The length depends on the value you set in the menu, and it is expressed
      in real life hours. That means meditating won't cause you to get new contracts and
      the only way to get new ones is to go for another noticeboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contracts that are generated each interval are seeded from the time spent
      in the playthrough and the location. This means that during the first hour of a
      playthrough the contract in White Orchard will be the same for all players
      across all computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If needed, the mod menu exposes a slider that can be changed to use another
      seed. However this will follow the same logic, any player with the same seed
      will get the same contracts or the same amount of time spent in the playthrough.
